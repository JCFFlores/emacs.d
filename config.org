* Introduction to awesome JCFFlores Emacs config
The purpose of this emacs config file is to learn more about emacs lisp
and the internals of emacs, as well as to leverage the opportunity to toy
a little bit with literate programming.
* Initial setup
** Package configuration
*** Require package.el before continuing
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
#+end_src
*** Add archives
The melpa archive is required to install most packages, the org archive
is required to install org-plus-contrib package later on
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)
#+end_src
*** Initialize packages
This is required for the package initialization to work, for Emacs 27 this
line won't be needed and it's gonna be necessary to check if some reordering
is to be applied to the config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package-initialize)
#+end_src
** Custom configuration
*** TODO Make this safe to run when a custom.el file doesn't exist
Set the custom-file variable and load it
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
(load custom-file)
#+end_src
** Required packages
This are packages that come bundled with emacs, for packages downloaded from an
archive ~use-package~ is used.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'subr-x)
#+END_SRC
* Remote client configuration
This configuration is used at work to open local emacs from a remote server
and edit files through tramp.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when-let* ((server-key (getenv "SERVER_KEY")))
(setq server-use-tcp)
(setq server-port 14000)
(setq server-auth-key server-key)
(server-start))
#+END_SRC
